# Crop_Yield_Prediction_Regression_Neural_Network_Model_in_TensorFlow
Crop yield prediction is essential for effective agricultural planning and decision-making. In this project, weâ€™ll build a regression model using neural networks to predict crop yields based on historical data from the Kaggle Crop Production Statistics dataset.
