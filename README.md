# Crop Yield Prediction using Neural Networks
---

## Introduction
Crop yield prediction is essential for effective agricultural planning and decision-making. In this project, we'll build a regression model using neural networks to predict crop yields based on historical data from the Kaggle Crop Production Statistics dataset.

## Steps

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Load the Kaggle Crop Production Statistics dataset.
- Handle missing values (impute or drop).
- Scale numerical features (e.g., rainfall, temperature) to a common range.

### 2. Feature Selection
- Choose relevant features for predicting crop yield.
- Consider factors like rainfall, temperature, fertilizer usage, and historical yield data.

### 3. Neural Network Architecture
- Design a feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers.
- Specify the number of neurons in each layer.
- Use activation functions (e.g., ReLU) for non-linearity.
- The output layer will have a single neuron for yield prediction.

### 4. Model Training
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Train the neural network using backpropagation and gradient descent.
- Monitor loss and validation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error).

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model on the test set.
- Calculate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### 6. Prediction
- Use the trained model to predict crop yields for new data.

## Example Code (Python)
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Load and preprocess the dataset (replace with actual data loading code)
# ...

# Create a neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(num_features,)))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1))  # Output layer for yield prediction

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_absolute_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

# Evaluate the model
test_loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test MAE: {test_loss:.2f}")

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_new_data)
```

## Conclusion
By following these steps and fine-tuning the neural network architecture, we can improve the accuracy of our crop yield predictions. Remember to adapt this README for your specific project and share your findings with the community! ðŸŒ¾ðŸ“ˆ
